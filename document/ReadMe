To get better understanding of the Spring Security Internal Working:

A. Search(Shift+shift), classes: "BasicAuthenticationFilter.java".
B. Exploring "doFilterInternal": will perform following operations:--

        1. Field "BasicAuthenticationConverter";  will show how:
                    a. Token is extracted from header
                    b. Token is decoded
               ->   c. "UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken" is generated.

        2. Field "AuthenticationManager" is an interface; will show how:
                A. "Authentication"  will be it's implementation
                    a. "ProviderManager"; will show how:
                        1. From various "AuthenticationProvider" required/suitable authentication
                           provider is chose by Iterating all authentication provider.
                ->      2. An "Authentication" object is returned. [Authenticated Object].

        3. "SecurityContext" object is created in which "Authentication" object is passed
        4. Thus "SecurityContextHolder" is set with(securityContext).
        5. Hence, on "onSuccessfulAuthentication" other parameters are set and passed to the browser as
           Authorised User (Principal).
